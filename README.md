# Uber Clone App


## Overview

This is an Uber Clone project that aims to replicate the core functionality of the Uber ride-sharing app. The project is divided into two main components: a backend API built using FastAPI and a frontend application developed with React. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up and running both the backend and frontend components, and other important information for developers and contributors.

## Features

- User registration and authentication.
- User and driver profiles.
- Booking and tracking rides.
- Real-time location tracking.
- Payment processing.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-clone.git
   cd uber-clone/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext

   ```

   Replace `username`, `password`, and `your_secret_key` with your own values.

5. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory of the project:

   ```bash
   cd uber-clone/frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
